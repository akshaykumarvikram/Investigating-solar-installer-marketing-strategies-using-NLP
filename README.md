# Investigating solar installer marketing strategies using natural language processing
This analysis explores residential solar PV marketing practices. Solar installers' roles are to not only carry out the technical aspects of installing the solar panels; they must also acquire new customers by marketing and selling to a diverse group of potential adopters looking to fulfill a diverse set of expectations from installing solar. The solar installer's marketing strategy must resonate with potential adopters who are looking for a variety of benefits from and information about installing solar PV. The solar installer gives a variety of information from spending less on electricity to reducing their environmental impact to how changes in policies will impact their investment.<br>
This analysis unsupervised staticstial topic modeling to classify solar installer tweets to better understand their marketing strategies and how they communicate with potential solar adopters. For instance, do solar installers conduct more inbound or outbound marketing? And within inbound marketing, which topics are referenced by individual companies and by industry as a whole.
As tweets have a timestamp, analysis also derives trends in solar marketing.<br>
The project includes use the following natural language processing techniques to classify solar installers tweets into particular topics: bag of words, LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation), and K-MEANS<br>
I have borrowed from this analysis to conduct the research.<br>
